# Netflix-Clone
A fully responsive Netflix Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or with your tech stack â€” update accordingly). This project replicates the UI/UX of the original Netflix app, showcasing movie posters, hover effects, a navbar, banner section, and an interactive layout. Ideal for front-end development practice and showcasing skills in responsive design.
